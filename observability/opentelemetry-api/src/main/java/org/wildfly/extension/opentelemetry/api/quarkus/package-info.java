/**
 * This package contains code that has been forked from Quarkus and modified to make work in the context of WildFly. The
 * intent is to experiment with the use of Quarkus' Vertx-based OTLP exporters. If/when this experiment succeeeds, the
 * code should be donated, in some form and if desired upstream to the openteletry-java project, or, failing that, perhaps
 * smallrye-opentelemetry. Regardless, the code would exist in one place and be shared by both Quarkus and WildFly.
